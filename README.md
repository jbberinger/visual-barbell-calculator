Visual Barbell is a modern web application for visualizing and calculating barbell weights.

* **Equipment:** Customize plate counts and equipment weights.
* **Units:** Choose between lbs and kgs, and convert between them.
* **Dimensions:** Dimensions and colors are based on real equipment.
* **Persistent Settings:** Equipment settings instantly save and persist between sessions.

## Tips 💪
**Plates are calculated in pairs**

* Plate counts are calculated in pairs and match the barbell drawn on the screen.
  * 225lb = (2 x 45lb) per side + 45lb barbell
  * 327.5kg = (6 x 25kg + 1 x 1.25kg + 2.5kg collar) per side + 20kg barbell

**Equipment**

* The default plate counts and equipment weights are based on those commonly available in commercial gyms.
* Can be customized to meet the needs of powerlifters, weightlifters, and those with limited equipment.

**Rounding**
* Plate counts are conservative and will always round down.
